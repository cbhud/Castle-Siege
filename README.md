## Installation Guide

### Requirements:

- Minecraft server running **Spigot**, **Paper**, or **Purpur** (version 1.17+).
- Java **17** or later.

### Steps:

1. Download the latest Castle Siege JAR from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/castle-siege-king-teams-kits-abilities-coins-stats-map-regeneration-more.115123/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/cbhud/Castle-Siege).
2. Place the JAR file into your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Restart the server to enable the plugin.
4. Configure the plugin using the provided configuration files.

----------

## Configuration

### Main Configuration File (`config.yml`)

Adjust key settings such as team names, game duration, kit prices, king health, and coin rewards.

- **maxPlayersPerTeam**: Maximum players per team (default: 16).
- **auto-start-players**: Minimum players required to start the game automatically.
- **king-health**: Health points for the King (default: 80.0).

### Kit Configuration (`kits.yml`)

The **kits.yml** file allows customization of kits, item prices, and abilities. For stability, avoid altering team and kit names.

### Map Regeneration

The **Map Regeneration System** ensures that gameplay starts fresh after every round by restoring broken or modified map elements. Key features include:

- **Automatic Fence Restoration**: Any destroyed oak fences, crucial to gameplay as obstacles or defenses, are rebuilt at the end of each game.
- **Manual Saving**: Server admins can use the `/cs save` command to define new fence positions if the map layout changes or is edited.
- **Real-Time Repair During Gameplay**: Defenders can manually rebuild destroyed fences during the game to slow down attackers. This mechanic adds a strategic layer to team defense.
- **Performance Optimized**: The regeneration process is lightweight, ensuring no lag or performance drops even on large maps.

To customize this system, ensure proper configuration in the plugin's settings and use the `/cs save` command after editing your map.
